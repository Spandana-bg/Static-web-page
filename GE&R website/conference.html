               business, management, information technology, engineering, medical, education, and other areas. 
               The changing management scenario and the advent of the digital economy have necessitated conferences

               papers that contribute to the area of research in business and management.</p><br>

               on topics relevant to research in the field of business, management, information technology, engineering, and 
               education. The pedagogic society under the banner of GERA has taken up the pious, legitimate, and noble task 
               of guiding the large segment of teacher educators in its proper perspective before they join the perspective 
               field. All papers are peer-reviewed and newly selected panels of international referees have been appointed to 
               ensure that the process must be done rapidly and to the highest standards. Special topics will provide accounts 
               of research, written periodically at the invitation of the Editorial Board under the direction of the Editor-in-Chief.

                <h1>Need of Research</h1><br>
                <p>Research is a complex activity and many factors determine the success of this activity. 
                   The nature and quality of instructional material, the learning environment, and the motivation 
                   of the students are all important and must be kept in view in an effort to ensure quality in 
                   teaching-learning. Education in its broadest sense presupposes a better understanding of teaching 
                   and learning. On one side, teachers are supposed to be able to impart their knowledge through the 
                   many approaches, methods, and techniques at their disposal. Teaching, for instance, requires a basic 
                   skill in explaining abstract concepts. Abstract thinking is one of the skills to be introduced to students 
                   at an early stage of learning this science. In India, however, a study has often been cited as a “monster” 
                   that troubles the student’s progress in learning for a higher level of education. On the other, students 
                   particularly those who will continue their studies to a tertiary level are confronted with the various problems 
                   of life. They lack books, especially the translated texts, and other learning aids. Unlike in advanced countries, 
                   the students in India entirely depend on the explanation given by their teachers. This is especially true of learning as 
                   the basic science to further their studies.
